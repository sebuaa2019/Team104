Description: An rqt-based tool that assists monitoring tasks
           for <a href="http://ros.org/wiki/moveit">MoveIt!</a> motion planner
           developers and users. Currently the following items are monitored if they
           are either running, existing or published:
           <ul>
           <li>Node: /move_group</li>
           <li>Parameter: [/robot_description, /robot_description_semantic]</li>
           <li>Topic: Following types are monitored. Published &quot;names&quot; are ignored.<br/>
               [sensor_msgs/PointCloud, sensor_msgs/PointCloud2,
                sensor_msgs/Image, sensor_msgs/CameraInfo]</li>
           </ul>
           Since this package is not made by the MoveIt! development team (although with
           assistance from the them), please post issue reports to the designated
           tracker (not MoveIt!'s main tracker).
