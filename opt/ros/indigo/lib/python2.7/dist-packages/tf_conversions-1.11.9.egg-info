Description: This package contains a set of conversion functions to convert
        common tf datatypes (point, vector, pose, etc) into semantically
        identical datatypes used by other libraries. The conversion functions
        make it easier for users of the transform library (tf) to work with
        the datatype of their choice. Currently this package has support for
        the Kinematics and Dynamics Library (KDL) and the Eigen matrix
        library. This package is stable, and will get integrated into tf in
        the next major release cycle (see roadmap).
